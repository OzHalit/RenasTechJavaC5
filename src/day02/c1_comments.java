    // This is my note to myself so I know how to use comments.

    //there are two types of comments appearently, first one being single line and the other being multi-line.

    //Comments won't effect your actual code bro, it's like the comments on html..

    //main method: to be able to run our code we will need to have main method
    public static void main(String [] args){ //opening bracket for main method

            //this is println which helps us to print in the console
        System.out.println("This is comment class");
        System.out.println("Hello bro, this be Halit");

    }//<--this is closing method for main method


}


/*
I think this is opening and closing comment command..
